1. Overview of GPU's
  People have been using comptuers to display pretty pictures for a very long time. I am going to give a brief
  overview of the history of consumer computer graphics.
1. Pixel Based (Little to no acceleration)
  For most of the history of comsumer machines the resolution of dispayed images was limited by how much memory the 
  computer had. For example a 1080p image takes up 1 Megabyte of space. Up until 1985 it would be impossible to store
  that much data in the computers memory (ASSEMBLY BOOK). Consumer computers graphics system worked around memory limitations
  by limiting the resolution and number of colors. Limiting the colors is especially helpfull because each additional color
  requires more space inorder to encode the data. One example system is VGA (Video Graphics Array)
2. Sprite acceleration
  
3. 3d Accelerators
4. General Purpose Compute
