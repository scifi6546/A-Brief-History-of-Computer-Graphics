1. Overview of GPU's
  People have been using comptuers to display pretty pictures for a very long time. I am going to give a brief
  overview of the history of consumer computer graphics.
1. Pixel Based (Little to no acceleration)
  For most of the history of comsumer machines the resolution of dispayed images was limited by how much memory the 
  computer had. For example a 1080p image takes up 1 Megabyte of space. Up until 1985 it would be impossible to store
  that much data in the computers memory (ASSEMBLY BOOK). Consumer computers graphics system worked around memory limitations
  by limiting the resolution and number of colors. Limiting the colors is especially helpfull because each additional color
  requires more space inorder to encode the data. One example system is VGA (Video Graphics Array). VGA is still present in
  the form of the connecture used for it, the VGA connector. VGA has a resolution of 320x200 Pixels with 256 possible colors. 
  This video mode is very limiting because the programmer has to manually place every pixel on the screen and this takes the
  computer quite a bit of time.
2. Sprite acceleration
  In the 1980's and the early 90's many home computers were built to do work rather than play games, therefore many
  of the video systems were built inorder to accomadate bisinuss users rather than games. Many games systems however, such
  as the Super Nintendo Entertainment system were built from the ground up inorder to play games. One of these features 
  were sprites shich were basically images that the programmer could move around. This approach made some games much 
  faster. For example the texture of an enemy could be a sprite and multiple sprites could be moved on the screen without
  the programmer directly changing each pixel in the enemy. This makes the game much faster as the computer does not have
  to tell the video chip what color every single pixel will have.
